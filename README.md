# mediasort
Move images and video files into subfolders grouped by year, month or day.
If EXIF data exists, exif datetime will be used.
If there is no EXIF datetime, the filename will be parsed for a datetime string.

This was made for usage on my Synology Diskstation.
*Install the DSM package Python Modules to run it
